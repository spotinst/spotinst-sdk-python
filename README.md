# spotinst-sdk-python
Spotinst SDK for the Python programming language

# **V2 Is Coming!**
Version 2 for the Spotinst Python SDK will be moving from the `v2` branch to the `master` branch very soon. The current `master` will move to it's own `v1` branch and eventually be deprecated.  Version 2 introduces some breaking changes from v1 and will require updates when switching over. Luckily this process should be easy and is completely explained on the [v2 branch in this repository](https://github.com/spotinst/spotinst-sdk-python/tree/v2).  Both `v1` and `v2` will be released as `spotinst-sdk` and `spotinst-sdk2` respectively, to prevent any auto version upgrades.

## Installation
```bash
pip install --upgrade spotinst-sdk
```

## Configuring Credentials
The mechanism in which the sdk looks for credentials is to search through a list of possible locations and stop as soon as it finds credentials. 
The order in which the sdk searches for credentials is:
  1. Passing credentials as parameters to the `SpotinstClient()` constructor
- example
```python
client = SpotinstClient(auth_token='token', account_id='act-123')
```

  2. Fetching the account and token from environment variables under `SPOTINST_ACCOUNT` & `SPOTINST_TOKEN`

If you choose to not pass your credentials directly you configure a credentials file, this file should be a valid `.yml` file.
The default shared credential file location is `~/.spotinst/credentials` and the default profile is `default`
- example
```yaml
default: #profile
  token: $defaul_spotinst_token
  account: $default_spotinst-account-id
my_profle:
  token: $my_spotinst_token
  account: $my_spotinst-account-id
```

  3. You can overwrite the credentials file location and the profile used as parameters in the `SpotinstClient()` constructor
- example
```python
client = SpotinstClient(credentials_file='/path/to/file', profile='my_profile')
```
  
  4. You can overwrite the credentials file location and the profile used as environment variables `SPOTINST_PROFILE` and/or `SPOTINST_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`
  5. Fetching from the default location with the default profile
