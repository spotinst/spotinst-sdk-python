## Installation
```bash
pip install --upgrade spotinst-sdk
```

## Configuring Credentials
The mechanism in which the sdk looks for credentials is to search through a list of possible locations and stop as soon as it finds credentials. 
The order in which the sdk searches for credentials is:
  1. Passing credentials as parameters to the `SpotinstClient()` constructor
- example
```python
client = SpotinstClient(auth_token='token', account_id='act-123')
```

  2. Fetching the account and token from environment variables under `SPOTINST_ACCOUNT` & `SPOTINST_TOKEN`

If you choose to not pass your credentials directly you configure a credentials file, this file should be a valid `.yml` file.
The default shared credential file location is `~/.spotinst/credentials` and the default profile is `default`
- example
```yaml
default: #profile
  token: $defaul_spotinst_token
  account: $default_spotinst-account-id
my_profle:
  token: $my_spotinst_token
  account: $my_spotinst-account-id
```

  3. You can overwrite the credentials file location and the profile used as parameters in the `SpotinstClient()` constructor
- example
```python
client = SpotinstClient(credentials_file='/path/to/file', profile='my_profile')
```
  
  4. You can overwrite the credentials file location and the profile used as environment variables `SPOTINST_PROFILE` and/or `SPOTINST_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`
  5. Fetching from the default location with the default profile
